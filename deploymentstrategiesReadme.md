q1.How do you implement rollback strategy in ECS?
---

ans.. In Amazon ECS, rollback strategies are about ensuring that if a new deployment fails (for example, a bad image, misconfig, or health check failures), the service automatically or 

manually reverts to the previous working task definition.Here‚Äôs how rollback strategies can be implemented in ECS (both ECS on EC2 and ECS on Fargate):
1. Using CodeDeploy with ECS (Blue/Green)

If you deploy services with AWS CodeDeploy + ECS Blue/Green (often via CodePipeline):

CodeDeploy shifts traffic from the old (blue) task set to the new (green) one gradually or all-at-once.

Health checks (from ELB/Target Group) validate if the new tasks are healthy.

If deployment fails (health check timeout, alarms triggered):

CodeDeploy automatically stops the green deployment.

Rolls back traffic to the previous (blue) task set.

ECS retains the last known good task definition.

You can configure CloudWatch alarms or manual approval in CodeDeploy to trigger rollback.

‚úÖ Best for zero-downtime + safe rollback.

2. ECS Deployment Circuit Breaker (Recommended)

Amazon ECS has a built-in deployment circuit breaker:

Configured in the ECS service definition:

"deploymentConfiguration": {
  "deploymentCircuitBreaker": {
    "enable": true,
    "rollback": true
  }
}


If ECS detects tasks failing to start or failing load balancer health checks:

Circuit breaker stops the deployment.

ECS rolls back to the last working task definition automatically.

‚úÖ Best for simple, fast rollback without CodeDeploy.

3. Manual Rollback via Task Definition Versions

Every ECS deployment creates a new task definition revision:

If new deployment fails, you can manually:

Open the ECS service.

Select a previous task definition revision.

Force a redeploy (Update Service).

Can be automated using a script/CI/CD pipeline:

aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster my-cluster \
  --service my-service \
  --task-definition my-task:12


‚úÖ Simple, but requires manual intervention or automation.

4. CI/CD Driven Rollback (CloudWatch + Lambda)

Use CloudWatch alarms (e.g., on Application Load Balancer 5xx, ECS task failures, custom metrics).

Trigger a Lambda function that:

Calls aws ecs update-service with the last known good task definition.

Can be integrated with CodePipeline for automatic rollback triggers.

‚úÖ Useful for custom health criteria beyond ECS/ELB.


q2.How do you achieve zero downtime in EC2-based deployments?
---

Achieving zero downtime deployments on EC2-based environments means serving user traffic continuously while rolling out new application versions. 
Since EC2 doesn‚Äôt have built-in deployment orchestration like ECS/EKS, you need to carefully design your deployment strategy. Here are the main approaches:

1. Load Balancer with Blue-Green Deployment

Setup:

Have two environments (Blue = current, Green = new).

Both are behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB/ALB) or target groups.

Process:

a.Deploy new version (Green) to a fresh set of EC2 instances or ASG.
b.Run health checks to ensure Green is stable.

c.Switch ELB traffic from Blue ‚Üí Green.

d.Keep Blue running for rollback safety.

Rollback: Switch traffic back to Blue.

2. Rolling Deployment with Auto Scaling Groups

Setup:

Application is running in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) behind a Load Balancer.

Process:

Launch new EC2 instances (with updated AMI or user-data for app).

ELB health checks ensure only healthy new instances serve traffic.

Gradually terminate old instances while scaling in new ones.

Rollback: Halt rollout, terminate bad instances, redeploy old AMI.

‚úÖ Lower infra overhead than Blue-Green.
‚ùå Slower rollback if errors slip through.

Run health checks to ensure Green is stable.

Switch ELB traffic from Blue ‚Üí Green.

Keep Blue running for rollback safety.

Rollback: Switch traffic back to Blue.

‚úÖ Fast rollback, predictable.
‚ùå Requires more infrastructure temporarily.

3. Canary Deployment

Setup:

Small subset of EC2 instances with new version, rest with old.

Process:

Deploy new version to 1‚Äì2 instances in the ASG.

Route small % of traffic (using ALB weighted target groups or Route53 weighted DNS).

Gradually increase traffic split if metrics look good.

Rollback: Remove canary instances, keep old version serving traffic.

‚úÖ Early detection of issues.
‚ùå Needs strong monitoring & routing controls.


q3)How do you deploy updates in an Auto Scaling Group with zero downtime?
---

ans)Deploying updates to an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with zero downtime is all about introducing new instances with the updated version while
keeping the old ones serving traffic until the new ones are healthy. Let me walk you through it:

Steps for Zero Downtime Deployment with ASG
1. Bake a New AMI (Best Practice)

Use Packer / CodeBuild / Jenkins to bake a new AMI that already contains the new application version.

This ensures consistency across all new instances.

2.Update the Launch Template/Config

Modify the ASG to use the new AMI (or new launch template version).

This tells the ASG: future instances should use this new version.

3.Rolling Replacement of Instances

Configure the ASG to gradually replace old instances with new ones:

Increase desired capacity by +1 (or a batch).

ELB/ALB runs health checks ‚Üí if healthy, new instances start receiving traffic.

Terminate one old instance.

Repeat until all instances are replaced.

üëâ This rolling pattern ensures at least N instances are always available, preventing downtime.

4.Health Checks

Use ALB/ELB health checks to ensure only healthy instances enter the load balancer pool.

If a new instance fails, rollout pauses ‚Üí prevents downtime.
In interviews or real-world, the best phrasing is:

‚ÄúWe achieve zero downtime in ASG deployments by using an ALB with health checks, updating the launch template to point to a new AMI, 
and letting the ASG perform a rolling replacement of instances while connection draining ensures active requests complete. 
For safer rollouts, we sometimes use a Blue/Green ASG approach with weighted traffic shifting.‚Äù


q4)How do you handle blue-green deployments and traffic shifting?
----

Blue-Green Deployment & Traffic Shifting
üîµ What is Blue-Green?

You run two environments:

Blue = current production environment (v1).

Green = new environment (v2).

Both environments are identical in infrastructure (EC2, ASG, containers, DB migrations carefully managed).

At any time, only one serves live traffic.


üõ† How It Works

Blue is live, serving 100% of traffic.

Deploy the new version to Green (isolated environment).

Run tests, smoke checks, health checks on Green.

If Green passes ‚Üí shift traffic from Blue ‚Üí Green.

Keep Blue running temporarily for rollback.

If an issue is found ‚Üí switch traffic back to Blue instantly.

Traffic Shifting Mechanisms
1. Load Balancer Switching (Most Common on AWS EC2)

Use an ALB/ELB/NLB:

Blue ASG is registered to Target Group A.

Green ASG is registered to Target Group B.

Switch traffic:

Update ALB listener to forward 100% traffic to Green target group.

Blue can be deregistered but left running for rollback.

‚úÖ Fast rollback (change listener back to Blue).
‚úÖ AWS CodeDeploy + ALB supports this natively.

2. Weighted Traffic Shifting (Gradual Cutover)

Instead of an instant switch, route traffic gradually:

Route53 weighted DNS ‚Üí send 10% to Green, 90% to Blue ‚Üí then 50/50 ‚Üí then 100% Green.

ALB Weighted Target Groups (with AWS CodeDeploy/Service Mesh) ‚Üí similar idea, fine-grained control.

Useful for canary-style deployments within Blue-Green.

‚úÖ Safer, detects issues early.
‚ùå Slightly more complex, requires monitoring + rollback automation.

3. Service Mesh / API Gateway

With Istio/Linkerd/App Mesh or API Gateway:

Shift traffic at the request level (e.g., 1% Green, 99% Blue).

Great for microservices where finer control is needed.

üîí Rollback Plan

If Green has issues:

Instantly point traffic back to Blue.

No new deployment needed ‚Üí rollback is just traffic re-route.

This is the #1 advantage of Blue-Green.

‚úÖ Example on AWS EC2 + ASG + ALB

Blue ASG (AMI v1) ‚Üí ALB Target Group A (100% traffic).

Deploy new Green ASG (AMI v2).

Test internally ‚Üí Green healthy.

Update ALB listener ‚Üí shift to Green‚Äôs Target Group B.

Monitor CloudWatch metrics/logs.

If stable, terminate Blue ASG. If not, rollback ALB listener ‚Üí Blue.

Interview-Friendly One-Liner

‚ÄúWe handle Blue-Green deployments by maintaining two identical environments. 
We deploy the new version to the Green environment, validate it, and then shift traffic using either ALB target groups or weighted Route53 records.
This ensures zero downtime and instant rollback by switching traffic back to Blue if issues occur.‚Äù

q5)A critical app broke after deployment. How do you restore service immediately?
----

ans.this is a classic on-call / SRE / DevOps interview scenario.
When a critical app breaks right after deployment, the top priority is restoring service immediately (not debugging the root cause first). Here‚Äôs how you should think about it:

Immediate Recovery Steps
1. Stop the Rollout

If deployment is still in progress ‚Üí pause/abort it.

Prevent more unhealthy instances from coming online.

2. Rollback to Last Known Good State

Blue-Green: Switch traffic back to Blue (old environment).

ASG Rolling Update: Revert ASG launch template to the previous AMI and recycle instances.

CodeDeploy: Use automatic rollback if health checks fail.

Container Deployments: Rollback to previous image tag (e.g., v1.2.3).

Infrastructure as Code: Redeploy the last stable release (Git tag / previous pipeline run).

üëâ The key is: deploying the previous version is usually faster than debugging the broken one.

3. Ensure Traffic & Health

Verify Load Balancer is routing only to healthy instances.

Enable connection draining so no user request gets dropped.

Check CloudWatch / Prometheus / logs for confirmation service is healthy again.

üßë‚Äçüíª Supporting Practices

Immutable deployments (baked AMIs, container images) make rollbacks reliable.

Blue-Green with ALB/Route53 allows instant cutover.

Canary deployments minimize blast radius before full rollout.

CI/CD auto-rollback: Integrate health checks ‚Üí pipeline reverts automatically if metrics fail.

Interview-Friendly Answer

‚ÄúIf a critical app breaks after deployment, I immediately stop the rollout and restore service by rolling back to the last known good version.
For example, in a Blue-Green setup, I‚Äôd point the load balancer back to the Blue environment. In an Auto Scaling Group,
I‚Äôd update the launch template to the previous AMI so healthy instances come back online. Once service is stable, 
I‚Äôd investigate logs, metrics, and deployment changes to find the root cause ‚Äî but restoring availability for users is always the first priority.‚Äù

q6)What can we improve in CI/CD to avoid such failures?
---
When a deployment caused a production outage, the main question is: what can we improve in CI/CD so this doesn‚Äôt happen again?

Improvements to CI/CD to Avoid Failures
1. Automated Testing Before Deploy

Unit tests, integration tests, contract tests ‚Üí run in pipeline.

Add smoke tests to validate API endpoints/UI after deployment to staging.

Shift-left testing ‚Üí catch issues earlier.

2. Staging / Pre-Prod Environments

Deploy to staging or pre-prod that mirrors production before prod rollout.

Run synthetic tests and performance tests there.

3. Blue-Green / Canary Deployments

Don‚Äôt ship directly to all users:

Blue-Green ‚Üí cutover only when new env passes health checks.

Canary ‚Üí start with 1‚Äì5% traffic, validate metrics, then increase gradually.

4. Health Checks & Auto Rollback

Integrate ALB/ELB health checks with pipeline.

If new version fails ‚Üí CI/CD pipeline auto-rolls back.

AWS CodeDeploy, ArgoCD, and Spinnaker all support this.

5. Feature Flags

Deploy code ‚Äúdark‚Äù (disabled by default).

Gradually enable features with feature toggles, so failures don‚Äôt require rollback of the whole app.

6. Observability in CI/CD

Integrate monitoring & alerting into pipeline:

CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana dashboards.

Automated checks on error rates, latency, resource usage during rollout.

Pipeline halts if SLIs/SLOs degrade.

Interview-Ready Answer

‚ÄúTo avoid such failures, we can strengthen our CI/CD pipeline by adding more automated tests and staging validation, 
adopting safer deployment strategies like Blue-Green or Canary with auto-rollback, and integrating observability so the pipeline halts if health checks or metrics fail.
Using feature flags and immutable artifacts further ensures safer rollouts. These improvements reduce the blast radius of bad deployments and make recovery automatic.‚Äù

q7)What‚Äôs the difference between blue-green, canary, and rolling deployments?
---

Interview-Friendly One-Liners

Blue-Green: ‚ÄúTwo environments ‚Äî deploy to Green, test, then flip all traffic from Blue ‚Üí Green. Instant rollback by switching back.‚Äù

Canary: ‚ÄúRelease to a small % of users/instances first, then ramp up gradually if metrics look good.‚Äù

Rolling: ‚ÄúReplace instances in batches ‚Äî new ones come in, old ones drain out ‚Äî until all are updated.‚Äù

Key takeaway:

Blue-Green = Fast cutover, best rollback.

Canary = Safest, minimizes risk with gradual rollout.

Rolling = Default in clusters/ASGs, but rollback is slower.
